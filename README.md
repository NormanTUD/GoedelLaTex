# GoedelLaTex
This is the paper "Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I." by logician Kurt Gödel completely retyped in LaTeX

# Stuff left to do

- Check for errors (there surely are plenty, this was really tough to type!)

- Remove some 'TODO's (mainly where new page numbers arose because of the new layout)

- Match the position of every word with the original document

- Integrate better tools for creating critical editions

# Thanks

Thanks to Lisa P. for painstakingly proofreading the first pages!
